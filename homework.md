### Homework 3, due Thursday, September 15

* Tao, ex. 1.2.1.
* Tao, ex. 1.2.2.
* Tao, ex. 1.2.5.
* Problem A. Show that the Jordan outer measure of a set E is equal to the infemum over all coverings of E by boxes B\_1,...,b\_k, of vol(B\_1)+...+vol(B\_k).
* Problem B. Recall G is a G\_delta set iff G is a countable intersection of open sets. Show that if A is Lebesgue measurable then there exists a G\_delta set G such that A is contained in G and m(G\\A)=0. Use the fact that G\_delta sets are measurable to show the converse holds as well.
