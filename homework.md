### Homework 9, due Thursday, November 10

* BBT, ex. 12:1.2 (ignore the part about the metric linear space)
* Suppose T:X&rarr;Y is a bounded operator. Let &alpha; be the infemum over all M such that for all x, ||Tx||&le;M||x||. Let &beta; be the supremum over all ||Tx|| such that ||x||&le;1. Show that &alpha;=&beta;.
