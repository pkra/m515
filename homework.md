### Homework 2. Due Friday, September 8

* Ex 3.2 ~ Tao ex 1.1.5. Show that $E$ is Jordan measurable iff for all $\epsilon>0$ there is an elementary set $A$ such that $m(E\triangle A)=0$.
* Ex 3.4 = Tao ex 1.1.12. Say that $E$ is \emph{Jordan null} if $E$ is Jordan measurable and $m(E)=0$. Show that any subset of a Jordan null set is a Jordan null set.
* Ex 3.5. Show that the outer Jordan measure $m^{*j}(E)$ is equal to: inf{\vol(B\_1)+\cdots+\vol(B\_k) : B\_1,\ldots,B\_k are boxes and E\subset B\_1\cup\cdots\cup B\_k}.
* Ex 4.2 = Tao ex 1.1.23. Let $f\colon[a,b]\to\RR$. Show that if $f$ is continuous, then $f$ is Riemann integrable. Show that if $f$ is bounded and piecewise continuous, then $f$ is Riemann integrable.
* Ex 4.3 = Tao ex 1.1.24. Show that the Riemann integral satisfies the linearity and monotonicity properties. (Hint: first establish these properties for the pc integral.)

### Homework 1. Due Friday, September 1

* Ex 1.1. Show that the properties (a)--(c) of a measure imply finite addivitity: If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint then $m(A\cup B)=m(A)+m(B)$.
* Ex 1.2. Show that the properties (a)--(c) of a measure imply the inclusion--exclusion principle: For any sets $A,B$ we have $m(A\cup B)+m(A\cap B)=m(A)+m(B)$.
* Ex 1.3. Complete the details of the proof that if there is a measure on $\RR$ satisfying properties (a)--(c), then there is a measure on $[0,1)$ (with additional modulo $1$) satisfying properties (a)--(c).
* Ex 2.1 = Tao ex 1.1.1. Show that the class of elementary sets is closed under the operations: union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference, and translation.
* Ex 2.2. Prove the elementary measure satisfies the monotonicity and finite subadditivity properties.
