## Course topics

Measure theory: This is a cornerstone of real analysis which shows up in many pure and applied areas of math including geometry, calculus, probability, and physical science. I plan to spend up to two-thirds of the semester on measure theory. We will cover a selection of topics from Tao’s book, sections 1.1–1.4. This includes the classical Lebesgue measure, measurable functions, integration, and abstract measure theory.

Functional analysis: This is another area of analysis that is important in a wide range of fields including differential equations, noncommutative algebra, and quantum mechanics. I plan to spend roughly one-third of the course on functional analysis. We will cover topics from from Bruckner et al, chapters 12–14. This includes Banach spaces, L^p spaces, and Hilbert spaces.

## Homework

Homework assignments will be assigned weekly, and collected on the following Thursday. I will check your work for completeness, and spot-check certain problems for correcteness and mathematical style. I encourage you to collaborate with your peers, and I don’t discourage you from using online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind that you must always fully understand your solutions and most importantly *write them in your own words*.
