Course topics {#course-topics .unnumbered}
-------------

Measure theory
:   This is a cornerstone of real analysis which shows up in many pure
    and applied areas of math including geometry, calculus, probability,
    and physical science. I plan to spend up to two-thirds of the
    semester on measure theory. We will cover a selection of topics from
    Tao’s book, sections 1.1–1.4. This includes the classical Lebesgue
    measure, measurable functions, integration, and abstract measure
    theory.

Functional analysis
:   Functional analysis is another area of analysis that is important in
    a wide range of fields including differential equations,
    noncommutative algebra, and quantum mechanics. I plan to spend
    roughly one-third of the course on functional analysis. We will
    cover topics from from Bruckner et al, chapters 12–14. This includes
    Banach spaces, $L^p$ spaces, and Hilbert spaces.

Homework {#homework .unnumbered}
--------

Homework assignments will be assigned weekly, and collected on the
following Thursday. I will check your work for completeness, and
spot-check certain problems for correcteness and mathematical style. I
encourage you to collaborate with your peers, and I won’t discourage you
from using online resources when you are stuck. But please keep in mind
that you must always fully understand your solutions and most
importantly *write them in your own words*.
